"""
Given a number N and a bit number K, check if Kth index bit of N is set or not. A bit is called set if it is 1. Position of set bit '1' should be indexed starting with 0 from LSB side in binary representation of the number.
Note: Index is starting from 0. You just need to return true or false, driver code will take care of printing "Yes" and "No".
